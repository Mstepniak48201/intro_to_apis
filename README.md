# Intro To APIs

## Overview

These are three projects that I did from the Tech With Tim Youtube channel. While much of the material in the notes.md file for each project is directly from the tutorials, I have documented my process as I work through new concepts, and have added a good deal of additional detailed information based on my individual research and work.

- A link to the relevant Tech With Tim video and github pages.
- A brief description
- Notable concepts
- Relevant thoughts
- How to use the API

The project is set up to send a request
